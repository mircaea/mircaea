## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my public git profile.

Currently working on my own Content Management System for creating secure, fast, close to zero cost but scalable, light weight web apps.
A live client-side demo [work in progress] can be found at [Stomable.com](https://stomable.com).

## My prefered stack is FERN (Firestore Express React Node)

## Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on \*ERN projects with passionate & constructive people.

ðŸŒ± Continously researching & improving, I'm passionate about:

> designing & building useful things

> solving problems

> sensors & embeded technologies

> bio-hacking & sports

> . . .

If I need a tool I usually buy it. Got lots of tools and I know exacly where they are. âœ¨
