## Hi there. ðŸ‘‹

My prefered stack is M/F ERN (MongoDB/Firestore Express React Node) with TypeScript, Redux with slices.

Iâ€™m open to working in dynamic teams on projects using modern technologies.

Currently creating a proprietary Content Management System for secure, fast, affordable[^1] and scalable web apps.

[^1]: zero-costs while within 50k reads and 20k writes from/to the db
